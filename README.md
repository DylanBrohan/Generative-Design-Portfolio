# Creative Coding

**Generative Design Portfolio**
Over the course of my final year in Computer Science I have accumulated a collection of Generative Design pieces from the module creative coding. This module allowed me to creatively expand on some ideas using code and develop these ideas by visually representing them on a canvas. These pieces are my portfolio of ideas that illustrate Creative Coding.

**The Creative Coding Pieces were all developed using the P5 library and its extensions.**

**All of the pieces demonstrated and coded were constructed using JavaScript and other canvas creating tools**
